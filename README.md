A Balatro mod made for Raichu!

**Balaichu** is an expansion for Balatro based on twitch streamer TheRaichu made in collaboration with a few members of the Raichu Ravine community. Featuring art from several talented artists, Balaichu adds 23 new Jokers, one new deck, and a new skin for each suit.

## Installation

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and the latest version of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) Without these dependencies, this mod will not function.

Once you've installed both lovely and Steammodded, download the [latest release](https://github.com/AhoyGamers/Balachu/releases/tag/Releases) zip file from the **Releases** tab and put the folder inside it in your Balatro Mods folder (`%APPDATA%/Balatro/Mods`). That's it!
