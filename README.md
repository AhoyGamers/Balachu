A Balatro mod made for Raichu!

**Balaichu** is an expansion for Balatro based on twitch streamer [TheRaichu](https://www.twitch.tv/theraichuuu) made in collaboration with a few members of the Raichu Ravine community. Featuring art from several talented artists, Balaichu adds 23 new Jokers, one new deck, and a new skin for each suit.

## Automatic Installation
Download the [Balachu installer.exe](https://github.com/AhoyGamers/Balachu/releases/tag/Releases) from the releases page and run it. Then run the game through Steam.

## Manual Installation

This mod requires [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and the latest version of [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/Steamodded) Without these dependencies, this mod will not function.

Once you've installed both lovely and Steammodded, download the [latest release](https://github.com/AhoyGamers/Balachu/releases/tag/Releases) zip file from the **Releases** tab and put the folder inside it in your Balatro Mods folder (`%APPDATA%/Balatro/Mods`). That's it! 

## Bugs
There are currently two bugs that may impact your gameplay experience.
1) If you continue a run with the balachu deck, the balachu jokers wont be considered common
2) When selecting balachu deck, all balachu jokers become common permanently
Basically, you absolutely have to finish any run with the Balachu deck in one sitting.
